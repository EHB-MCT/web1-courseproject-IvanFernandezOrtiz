						<h3>Videogames</h3>
						<p>Playing videogames has always been a huge part in my life. That's why it shouldn't be a surprise I still enjoy it to this day. Whether it's playing a compelling storygame or a competitive shooter, I'm guarenteed to enjoy it.</p>

						<h3>Anime/cartoons</h3>
						<p>I've always loved seeing animations on screen and am still baffled at how people can show so much emotion and action without being restricted to realism. Anything they can imagine can happen on screen and that's just amazing.</p>

						<h3>Manga / Comics</h3>
						<p>Reading manga is something that started in recent years. There are so many good stories that aren't animated or well adapted. Reading those stories straight from the source just has a different feel to it.</p>

						<h3>Brainteasers</h3>
						<p>
							As a child I sometimes got those metal braintwisters where you have to seperate 2 (or more) metal pieces and but them back together. That's how it started. Later on I started to get into wooden puzzles as well and eventually even
							Rubiks' Cubes. I think it's a fun activity to do to keep my brain active while listening to music or a podcast.
