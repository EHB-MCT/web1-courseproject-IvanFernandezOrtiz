				<h1>Main interests</h1>
				<p>My main interests lie in computers and animation. But why?</p>
				<div class="main-interests">
					<div>
						<h2>Computers</h2>
						<p>
							I've always been intrigued by the way computers simplify and enhance various tasks, making them more accessible. The speed at which computers process information is equally fascinatingâ€”tasks that might consume hours for humans can be
							executed within seconds by computers.
						</p>

						<h2>Animation</h2>
						<p>
							Animation is such an interesting medium to me. Having the possibility to make anything you want appear. It doesn't matter if it's real or not, the only limitation is your imagination, dedication and time. Another fascinating aspect of
							animation lies in the diverse methods available for bringing it to life, whether through the utilization of images, drawings, clay, and more.
